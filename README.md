----------+ Hello my name is Saad Khan +----------
I finally finished my Computer Engineering degree! ðŸŽ“
Progressively trying to better myself in different areas of life.
Never lose hope. Never give up. You can do this.
I love playing games, exercising and interacting with people while enjoying life on the go.
I hope to display my progress and work on my GitHub and hopefully, one day it'll all be worth it ðŸ–¤
