Hello my name is Saad Khan
I am a student currently studying Computer engineering.
I want to progressively get better at coding until i feel like i am well versed in various areas 
I love playing games, excercising and enjoying life on the go.
I hope to display my progress and work on my GitHub and hopefully, one day it'll all be worth it ðŸ–¤
